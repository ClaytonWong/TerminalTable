# TerminalTable
More demonstrations of terminal table.

TerminalTable.rb creates different terminal tables. You can only uncomment one challenge at at time or you will get messy printout.
TerminalTableV2.rb does almost the same but is neater because it prints a seperate table for each challenge, except for challenges 2 and 3.
